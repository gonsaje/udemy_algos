// What do they do?

// Collections of values, the relationships among them, 
// and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data

// Different data structures scel at different things. Some are highly
// specialized, while others (like arrays) are more generally used.


// The more tim you spend as a dev, the more likely you need to ue one of these data structures

// Working with map/location data? Use a graph

// Need an ordered list with fast inserts/removals at the beginning and the end? Use a linked list

// Web scraping nested HTML? Use a tree!

// Need to write a scheduler? use a binary heap
